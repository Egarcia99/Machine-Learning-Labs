# Machine Learning Labs

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and datasets used for completing various labs as part of the Exploratory Data Analysis in Machine Learning certification by IBM through Coursera. The labs cover a broad spectrum of topics including data reading, exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and hypothesis testing, crucial for anyone looking to excel in data science and machine learning.

## Libraries and Tools Used

The labs utilize a wide range of Python libraries and tools essential for data science and machine learning, including:

- Python: The core programming language used for all labs.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computing.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- Seaborn: For making statistical graphics.
- SQLite: For database management.
- SciPy: For scientific and technical computing.
- Jupyter Notebooks: Used as the development environment for executing Python code and presenting findings.

## Datasets

Various datasets are used throughout these labs, which include but are not limited to CSV files, JSON files, and SQLite databases. Notable datasets include:

- insurance.csv: Contains data related to insurance costs based on various factors.
- baseball.db: An SQLite database with information on baseball games.

## Labs Overview

- Data Reading and Exploration: Teaches the basics of reading data from different formats (CSV, JSON, databases) and preliminary exploration.
- Data Cleaning: Focuses on dataset cleaning, handling missing values, and data preparation.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Engages in both visual and statistical analysis to uncover data patterns, relationships, and insights.
- Feature Engineering: Discusses creating new features from existing data to enhance machine learning models.
- Hypothesis Testing: Introduces the concept of statistical hypothesis testing for informed data-driven conclusions.
